            <h2>My thoughts, stories and life.</h2>
            <p>My personal blog made from scratch, practicing the skills I've learned whilst learning web development, expressing my thoughts and opinions to the world. Enjoy.</p>

            <p>We all love the beautiful game, nothing can beat it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Come July 2021, I'll be undertaking what will be my 17th pre season ahead of another season playing the game we all love and i've been fortunate enough throughout my career to represent some great clubs in the English lower leagues.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Starting out at Port vale who are rivals of my hometown Crewe Alexandra, I completed my early football education YTS/scholarship coming up through the youth team ranks before turning professional with the club.</p>
            <br>

            <figcaption>A young me in my Port Vale days.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>After a few loan spells away from the club that year, I moved on from Port Vale I spent one year in Scotland with Clyde in what was then Scottish division 1, before moving back to the English pyramid by signing for Wrexham in the Conference National.</p>
            <br>
            <p><img class="cycle" src="../christians/resources/images/wrexham.jpg" alt="">Scoring on my debut on in the opening game of the season v Stevenage Borough, I went on to spend 3 seasons with the club.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With Wrexham being a big club, each year they're expected to challenge for promotion, despite failing two years in a row via the playoffs to do this, I was throughly enjoyed my time at the club, under then manager Dean Saunders given the amount of games I played at a young age plus the coaching I received.</p>
            <br>
            <p><img class="cycle2" src="../christians/resources/images/maid1.jpg" alt=""> From my time at Wrexham to now I have played for a vast number of clubs, having a variety of memories and made many life long friends along the way, the biggest highlight would be spending 4 seasons with Maidenhead United.</p>
            <br>
            <p>During my time with Maidenhead, it has been without doubt the most enjoyable in football, ultimately topped by creating history for the club by winning the Vanarama National South and being promoted to the Vanarama National for the first time in the clubs history.</p>
            <img class="champs" src="../christians/resources/images/champs.jpg" alt="">
            <p>As I write this article giving a brief run down of my journey in football, my season with Hampton & Richmond Borough has just come as an effect of no fans due to covid-19.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After signing with the club in the summer, we were in the middle of having a great season and the curtailment has been a big disappointment given our league position and the return to fitness of some of long term injured players.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Currently there is still a big question with regards to what happens next? when the new season will start and where I'll be playing my football next season?</p>
            <br>
            <p>Between now and then I will enjoy some time off, probably out cycling before getting back to it and working to get fit ahead of the new season.</p>
